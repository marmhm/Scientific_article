Here I summarize the paper titled "Writing a scientific article: A step-by-step guide for beginners"

**Don't you think that your work deserves to be judged on its scientific merit, rather than be rejected for poor quality writing and messy and confusing presentation of the data?**

## Getting started: things to do before you write a word
- Perform an extensive literature review to establish the current state of knowledge on the topic, and ensure the originality of your research
- **Use a software program for managing references** (This is so very important, based on my experience)
- Before starting to write, you should identify the target journal in which you intend to submit. This is for getting to know which format you should use, and how to present your content to the audience of the journal.
- Have the final results of your study and highlight the most important findings

## What are the main sections of a scientific article?
The introduction, methods, results, and discussion (**IMRAD**).

### The introduction section
The introduction must get the reviewer **'hooked'**
- Explain why you undertook your study, what you aimed to achieve with it, and how this constitutes a useful addition to the existing body of evidence on this topic
- Start by explaining briefly, using appropriate references, what is already known about this subject
- Logically lead to a description of an explicit gap in the knowledge that your study hopes to fill. This is an essential element in justifying the utility of your work.
- Clearly state your working hypothesis, followed by your objective(s), and very briefly, the strategy implemented to achieve these goals
- For related work: a careful selection of the most pertinent publications is sufficient
- The introduction section is your opportunity to state the added value of your study or the new information that your study will yield. Will your results change clinical practice? Will they help the scientific community at large to move towards consensus on a previously controversial topic by providing hard evidence in one direction or the other? This is your chance to make a sales pitch for your article
- Objectives must be explicitly stated and should include the exact parameter you aim to assess
- Do not be afraid of appearing repetitive; repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in an article. It shows the reader at least that you know what you are talking about, and using the same terms throughout avoids any confusion.
- Find a native English speaker to correct your text

### The methods section
- Write **"what you did"**
- Write **" any choices of unusual methodology for the design of the study should be justified"**

### The results section
- The aim of the results section is to describe what you observed, without commentary or discussion.
- A typical paragraph of results should start by recalling the type of analysis (e.g. **'QCA analysis revealed that. . .'**), then detail the results observed, referring to the relevant tables or figures

### The discussion section
This section is where you interpret and explain the significance of your results, and how they fit into the wider picture of what has already been observed and reported on the same topic.
- Start with a brief recap of the main findings of your study, preferably using the same formulation as that used for the primary objective
- Putting your results in perspective with other reports is an important part of the discussion. In doing this, you will naturally want to describe what other authors have reported in similar contexts, in order to compare to your findings.
- Explain why you observed what you observed?
- What are the novel findings of your study? How your findings yield new evidence or a new contribution to the state of knowledge will substantiate the importance of your paper, and its added value for the literature, as opposed to being **'just another paper'** on a **'worn-out'** topic. In this regard, you can discuss whether or not your paper has succeeded in filling the **'gap in knowledge'** that you justified in the introduction.
- How your results are likely to influence practice, or the state of knowledge.
- Write avenues for future research
- Finally, a short paragraph outlining the strengths and limitations of your study. It allows the reviewers to see that you are aware of your own shortcomings. Secondly, it provides an opportunity for you to defend yourself on these points, and state why the supposed limitation may not be so negative after all.

## The abstract
- The abstract is a short summary of the article in a few sections (usually background, methods, results, and conclusion).
- It is the quintessential marketing tool for your work

## The title
- The title should contain keywords to reflect the main issues in your article.
- It should distinguish itself from other articles by specifying how your article contributes to the literature or fills a gap in knowledge

## Get out your pen and start writing: it is what your work merits!
